# All-State-Purchase-Prediction-Challenge
Exploratory analyis example

This repository performs some initial analysis of data and fits some exploratory models to the All State Purchase Prediction Kaggle Challenge Competition.

The data is prepared and cleaned as a data.table. This would be useful to use as a template for cleaning data.

Some basic models are then fitted using the caret package. This would be useful to use as a template for splitting and fitting models to data.
